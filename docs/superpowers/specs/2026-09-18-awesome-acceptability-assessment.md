# Spec and assessment: awesome-acceptability-assessment (P4)

Date: 2026-09-18
Package: P4
Product: awesome-mbse (hub)

## Problem

sindresorhus/awesome list PR is deferred because the acceptability gate was never assessed for the hub, and the hub is still private.

## Research

Primary sources consulted this session:

- https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md (contribution guidelines; create-list guidance)
- https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/pull_request_template.md
- https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome (README list structure)
- docs/runbooks/family-public-release.md Checklist C (hub public prerequisite)

research: local assessment with official awesome contribution docs (URLs above)

## Assessment criteria (from awesome contribution guidance)

1. List must be useful and focused; not a dumping ground.
2. Descriptions must be clear and not promotional fluff.
3. Table of contents and consistent formatting.
4. Links must work; dead links fail review.
5. Prefer established resources; avoid low-quality or spam.
6. Naming: Awesome X pattern; avoid trademark abuse.
7. Review bandwidth: maintainers are slow; list must be high quality before PR.
8. Badge and LICENSE expectations for listed projects.

## Awesome MBSE against the bar

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | PASS | Hub MBSE/SysML index with deep Magic Grid / Cameo coverage; family spokes hold niches |
| Format | PASS | Hyphen entry format with tags and year; Contents present; awesome-lint in CI |
| Links | PASS process | lychee on README + docs/index.html; PR fail on product-surface rot |
| Naming | PASS | Awesome MBSE matches Awesome X |
| Badge | PASS | awesome.re badge already on README |
| Licence | PASS | CC0-1.0 list; upstream keep own licences |
| Depth | PASS | 85 grammar-valid curated bullets under Magic Grid, Broader SysML/MBSE Context, External lists |
| Freshness process | PASS | weekly lychee report + quarterly sweep badge |
| CONTRIBUTING | PASS | inclusion bar, tags, neutrality, landing truth section |
| Self-promotion | PASS | editorial neutrality; JGS products sit next to alternatives |
| Visibility | FAIL until flip | Repo is private; sindresorhus cannot review a private list. Family runbook Checklist B must run first |

## Decision

**Go, with prerequisites (not PR-now).**

Do **not** open the sindresorhus/awesome PR in this package. Prerequisites before a future PR:

1. Hub public via family-public-release Checklist B (human gate).
2. GitHub Pages live from main /docs; homepage URL set.
3. One clean full-sweep lychee run (README + landing) with zero open broken-link issues after the public flip.
4. Re-read the current PR template on sindresorhus/awesome the week of submission (templates change).
5. Confirm public-spoke FAMILY.md pointer class unlock after hub public (runbook).

**No-go** only if the project abandons public awesome-list distribution. That is not the case.

Depth is already strong (85 curated entries). The blocking prerequisite is visibility, not thin content.

## DISTRIBUTION.md update

Update the sindresorhus/awesome row: deferred with decision date 2026-09-18 and the go-with-prerequisites note above. Point at this assessment path.

## Non-goals

- Opening the PR in this package
- Org catalogue work (P3)
- Community directory scatter-posts
- Public visibility flip (human runbook)
